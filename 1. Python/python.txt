 - Popular Programming Language - Guido van Rossum in 1991 at CWI in the Netherlands

Reserved words or Keywords:
```````````````````````````
 - Keywords have special meanings to the compiler. There are 35 keywords.
 
False		await		else		import		pass
None		break	   	except		in		raise
True		class	   	finally		is		return
and 		continue   	for		lambda		try
as 		def 	   	from		nonlocal	while
assert		del   	   	global		not		with
async		elif	   	if		or		yield

Value Keywords		- 	True, False, None
Operator Keywords	- 	and, or, not, in, is
Control Flow Keywords	- 	if, elif, else
Iteration Keywords	- 	for, while, break, continue
Structure Keywords	- 	def, class, with, pass, lambda
Returning Keywords	-	return, yield
Import Keywords		- 	import, from, as
Exception-Handling Keywords -	try, except, raise, finally, assert
Asynchronous Keywords	    - 	async, await
Variable Handling Keywords  - 	del, global, nonlocal

True, False - Boolean value
 Eg:
    x = True			y = False
    x is True			y is not True
    # True			# True
    
None - Represents no Value
 Eg:
    def func():				- can't print the call 
    	print("hello")			- can't print the print
    x = func()
    # hello
    print(x)			
    # None
    
Variable
`````````
 Cotainers for storing data values. 
 Literals - Raw data assigned to a Variable or Constant
	
	- Python is case sensitive. Eg: y and Y are Different

  name  = "Shiffana" 
   |	      |
Variable   Literal


Data Types
``````````
In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store different kinds of data. 
Here is a comprehensive list of all the data types in Python:

Numeric Types:
int (integer)
float (floating-point number)
complex (complex number)

Sequence Types:
list (mutable ordered sequence of elements)
tuple (immutable ordered sequence of elements)
range (immutable sequence of numbers)

Text Type:
str (string of characters)

Mapping Type:
dict (mutable collection of key-value pairs)

Set Types:
set (mutable collection of unique elements)
frozenset (immutable collection of unique elements)

Boolean Type:
bool (boolean value True or False)

Binary Types:
bytes (immutable sequence of bytes)
bytearray (mutable sequence of bytes)
memoryview (memory view of a bytes object)


Numeric Types	:	int, float, complex
Text Type	:	str
Boolean Type	:	bool
Sequence Types	:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type	:	dict
Set Types	: 	set, frozenset
Binary Types	:	bytes, bytearray, memoryview
None Type	:	NoneType

Eg:
```
x = 1					- Integer 
x = 2.8					- Float	  
x = 1j					- Complex 
x = "Hello"				- String  
x = True				- Boolean	
x = ["apple","banana", "cherry"]	- List
x = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")	- Tuple
x = range(6)				- Range
x = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}	- Dictionary
x = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}	- Set
x = frozenset({"apple", "banana"})	- Frozenset
x = b"Hello"				- Bytes
x = bytearray(5)			- ByteArray
x = memoryview(bytes(5))		- MemoryView
x = None				- NoneType


Data Type:		Type Casting:	- Changing the type of data
``````````		`````````````
print(type(x))		x = int("3")		


String:
```````
 - Should be in ' '  or " "
 
 Length 	- len(a)
 Check  	- "Worth" in me 	- True
 		- "Quit" not in me 	- True
 Slice  	- a[2:1]/[2:]/[:2]/[-1:]
 Upper  	- a.upper()
 Lower  	- a.lower()
 Remove Space	- a.strip()
 Replace	- a.replace("F","S")
 Split		- a.split(",")
 Capitalize	- a.capitalize()
 Format		- a.format(done) - {}	- Add integer in string 
 Escape String 	- \
 		- \' , \\ , \n, \t 
		
		
Collection Data Types - List , Tuple , Set , Dictionary
List [] - Ordered , Changeable , Allow Duplicate values.
Tuple() - Ordered , Unchangeable , Allow Duplicate values.
Dict {} - Unordered , Changable , Doesn't Allow Duplicate values , Key - Value pairs.
Set  {}	- Unordered , Changebale - set, Unchangable - frozenset , Doesn't Allow Duplicate values. 


Accessing	- txt[1]/txt[2:5]
Checking	- if "apple" in txt:
Length		- len(txt)			- length of the list
Counting	- txt.count(apple)		- count the mentioned item in the list
Changing	- txt[1] = "banana"		- changing the item
Inserting	- txt.insert(3, "orange")	- inserted at the mentioned index
Append		- txt.append("cherry")		- inserted at the end
Extend		- txt.extend(list)		- adding two list
Remove		- txt.remove("banana")		- removing by item
Pop		- txt.pop(1)/()			- removing by index / last item
Deleting	- del txt[1]			- remove by index
		- del txt			- remove the entire list
Clear		- txt.clear()			- empty the list
Sorting		- txt.sort()			- ascending order
		- txt.reverse()			- decending order
		

Operators:
``````````
	- used to perform operations on variables and values

 Arithmetic Operator	- Numeric values to perform common Mathematical Operations
 			- + , - , * , / , % , ** , // 
			
 Assignment Operator	- Assign values to Variables 
 			- = , += , -=, *= , /=, %=, **=, //= , &= , |= , ^= , >>= , <<= 
 
 Comparison Operator	- Compare two values
 			- == , != , > , < , >= , <=
			
 Logical Operator	- Combine Conditional Statements
 			- and , or , not 
			
 Identity Operator	- Compare the objects
 			-  is , is not
			
 Membership Operator	- Test is a sequence is present
 			- in , not in
			
 Bitwise Operator	- Compare Binary Numbers
 			- & , | , ^ , ~ , << , >>
			

Object Oriented Programming:
```````````````````````````
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes to represent and manipulate data. 
In Python, you can use OOP concepts to design and create classes, objects, and methods that encapsulate data and behavior into a single unit. 
Here are some of the key OOP concepts in Python:

Class: 
A class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and methods (functions) that the objects of that class will have.

Object: 
An object is an instance of a class. It is created from a class and has its own unique data and behavior. 
Objects can be created, modified, and deleted dynamically during program execution.

Encapsulation: 
Encapsulation is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from the outside world and 
exposing only the necessary interface for interacting with the class. This helps to improve code modularity and reduce code complexity.

Inheritance: 
Inheritance is the ability of a class to inherit the attributes and methods of another class. 
It allows you to reuse existing code and create new classes that extend the functionality of existing classes.

Polymorphism: 
Polymorphism is the ability of different objects to respond to the same message (method call) in different ways. 
It allows you to write code that can work with different types of objects without knowing their specific types at compile-time.

In Python, you can use these OOP concepts to create reusable, modular, and maintainable code that is easier to understand and debug. 
OOP can be a powerful tool for solving complex programming problems and building robust software systems.
