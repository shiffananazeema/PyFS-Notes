     Data Structure and Algorithm
     ````````````````````````````

Data Structure and Algorithm helps you to store information neatly and
   and solve problems quickly and efficiently.

Algorithm - A step-by-step instruction to solve a problem or perform a task.
              Eg: Recipe to Cook

Data Structure - A way to organize and store data.
                    Eg: Container for holding information

[Note: Data structure and data types are slightly different. 
          Data structure is the collection of data types arranged in a specific order.]

Types of Data Structure:
````````````````````````
* Linear Data Structure
* Non-Linear Data Structure

Linear Data Structure:
``````````````````````
 - The elements are arranged in sequence on after the other. 

1. Array Data Structure
